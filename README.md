# University of Washington Data Science Certificate Programming Assignments
By: Kenji Oman

Courses from: January - August, 2018

This repo contains the programming assignments I completed for the [UW
data science certificate course
series](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/data-science), as an example of my
work.  The assignments are fairly raw (in the same form as how I submitted
them), so with time, I may clean them up a bit more for public consumption.

The assignments for Class 1 built upon each other, so the
[final presentation](Class1/KenjiOman-Presentation.ipynb)
would be a good place to look for an overview of that work.  Also, to note, the
assignments were required to be in .py files, although jupyter notebooks are a
more natural way to represent the work required.  As such, the final
presentation was done in the form of a jupyter notebook.

For Class 2, all the assignments/ milestones were fairly independent of each
other.

For Class 3, the assignments were independent of each other, but the
milestones were on the same project (merging Kaggle's traffic violations
data set for Montgomery County with Weather/ Daylight data).

# License
A note on license -- this work is strictly for educational purposes, and as
such, I open it to anyone else that might be able to learn from it (feel free
to fork, copy, tweak, etc, but don't submit it/ portions of it to other courses
as if it were your own!).  Additionally, this work should not be used for any
commercial purposes, even in modified form.  If derivative educational works
are created based on my work, I would appreciate attribution (standard academic
stuff -- don't plagiarize), and I retain copyright for any parts created by me.

And when in doubt, ping me and ask!  If I do grant any notable exceptions to
any individual/ organization, I'll make note of it here.

One final note -- some portions of the notebooks in Class 2 and 3 were provided
as a part of an assignment template (listing assignment requirements, etc), so
I recognize that these portions are probably technically UW property.  This
also includes the data in the "Data" directories.  If I hear from them about
tweaking the contents of this repo/ taking anything down, I am happy to comply.
